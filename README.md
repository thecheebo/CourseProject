# CS410 Classification Competition

Summary

	Our team was formed over slack when we were looking for fellow students to work with in the same metropolitan area.  We had wanted to have the option to meet up in person, as we are all from southern California. Unfortunately, due to COVID 19, all of our meetings ended up just being virtual meetups.  When one of us stumbled across the suggested tech review suggestions, BERT/ALBERT/Transformers caught our attention and appeared to be a perfect solution for the classification competition.  Because the competition had suggested “You will need to research by yourselves some cutting-edge models that are more recent than those introduced in the lectures” and “achieve the state-of-the-art performance”, we quickly realized that BERT and its many variants are going to be the perfect solution for the classification task at hand.
